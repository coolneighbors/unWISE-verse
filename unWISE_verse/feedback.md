## Alpha-0 Test

### **Feedback Summary**
* Add links: 
    WiseView
    SIMBAD
    VizeR
    IRSA Finder Chart
    LSSV

* Additional button for more than one moving object in a frame

* Add some form of exposure control

* Ensure that the grid doesnt cover any image content. Can there be a toggleable grid? Possibly have just the grid intersectuions as plus signs rather than whole lines

* Show which part of the frame is under investigation by highlighting or similar â€“ or is it better to look through the whole frame?

* Make image size approx. 387x387



## Alpha-1 Test

### **Feedback Summary**
* Add subject ID number to either image or metadata

* Should classifiers answer yes or no in cases where there is possibly movement but not guaranteed?

* Almost every subject seems to have motion, will that be typical in final set? Maybe we need to add non moving random fields to reach the sweet spot?

* Are classifiers expected to look into subject W1-W2 color values? If so, that training should be in the tutorial.

* Can we add a gaia overlay to the linked wiseview page?
